# Specification

## Business Goal

Explain why this work matters to users or the product. Focus on outcomes rather than implementation.

Structure:

Problem / pain description
Proposed solution

## Current Behavior

Provide a factual description of the current behavior based on the existing system or codebase. Split by layer (frontend, backend/API, data, etc.) where appropriate. Do not describe desired behavior.

Expected Behavior
Describe the expected user-visible and system-visible behavior after the work is complete.

### User Flow

Describe the expected user journey.

### Edge Cases

List important edge cases and how they should behave.

### Error Handling

Describe expected behavior for failures, validation errors, unavailable services, permission issues, and other error scenarios.

## Out Of Scope

List explicit exclusions to prevent scope creep.

## Technical Scope

Provide a high-level overview of the technical work, including affected layers and types of changes (UI, API, data model, integrations, etc.).

Do not include implementation steps, code, pseudocode, algorithms, diffs, or design decisions.

## Non-functional Requirements and Constraints

This section is intended to establish the boundaries the implementation must respect, not to document the architecture in depth. Include only points that:

  1. define technology stack and implementation constraints;
  2. prevent integration issues;
  3. help avoid operational or maintenance problems; or
  4. are mandatory architectural requirements that the implementation must follow

## Acceptance Criteria

Create independently testable user-scenario and business focused acceptance criteria (AC-1, AC-2, ...).

## Assumptions

List assumptions made while writing the specification. Clearly distinguish assumptions from constraints.
