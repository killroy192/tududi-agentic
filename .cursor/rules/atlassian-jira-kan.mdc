description: Restrict Atlassian MCP to read-only Jira project KAN
alwaysApply: true

# Atlassian / Jira scope

When using the Atlassian MCP:

- Use site / cloudId: `https://epam-team-ai-adoption.atlassian.net`
- Scope all JQL with `project = KAN` (board: projects/KAN/boards/1)
- Do not search or read issues outside project KAN
- Do not call write tools (create, edit, transition, comment, worklog, links)
- Prefer `maxResults: 10` (or equivalent limit) on Jira searches

Example JQL:

```
project = KAN AND status != Done ORDER BY updated DESC
```
